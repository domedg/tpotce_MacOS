## 1. Introduction üåç
**T-Pot** is an all-in-one honeypot platform designed by Deutsche Telekom. It supports multi-architectures (amd64, arm64) and offers a wide range of visualization options using the **Elastic Stack**, real-time animated attack maps, and numerous security tools to enhance the deception experience. üçØ

### 1.1 Features and Benefits üí°
T-Pot provides several key features that make it a powerful tool for cybersecurity professionals and researchers:

- **Comprehensive Honeypot Integration**: T-Pot combines over 20 honeypots, each designed to capture different types of malicious activity. This integration allows for monitoring and analyzing a wide variety of attack vectors.
  
- **Elastic Stack Integration**: The platform includes the **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), facilitating data collection, analysis, and visualization. This integration offers powerful tools for real-time threat intelligence.

- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Using Docker and Docker Compose, T-Pot simplifies deployment and management. Each honeypot runs in its own container, ensuring isolation and ease of maintenance.

- **Advanced Visualization Tools**: T-Pot provides tools like **CyberChef**, **Elasticvue**, and a real-time attack map, making it easy to interpret and understand the data collected by the honeypots.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: T-Pot can be deployed on multiple Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows (with limited functionality). It can run on physical hardware, virtual machines, or cloud environments like AWS.

- **Community Data Sharing**: By default, T-Pot sends data to the **Sicherheitstacho** community backend, contributing to collective threat intelligence. This feature can be disabled if needed.

### 1.2 Architecture üèóÔ∏è
The core components of T-Pot have been moved into a Docker image called **tpotinit**. This change has made T-Pot compatible with multiple Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows (with some limitations due to Docker Desktop). T-Pot uses **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to run as many honeypots and tools as possible simultaneously, maximizing the host's hardware utilization.

## 2 MacOS Installation üçè
As Docker Desktop is rather limited not all honeypot types or T-Pot features are supported. Also remember, by default the macOS are blocking access from remote, so testing is limited to the host.

To get things up and running just follow these steps:
1. Install Docker Desktop for [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
2. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/domedg/tpotce_MacOS/
   ```
4. Go to : `cd tpotce_MacOS/`
5. Copy `cp compose/mac_win.yml ./docker-compose.yml`
6. Check if the script "genuser.sh" is executable, if is not run `chmod 777 genuser.sh`
7. Create a `WEB_USER` by running `./genuser.sh`
   
8. Adjust the `.env` file by changing `TPOT_OSTYPE=linux` to either `mac` or `win`:
9. You have to ensure on your own there are no port conflicts keeping T-Pot from starting up.
10. Start T-Pot: `docker compose up` or `docker compose up -d` if you want T-Pot to run in the background.
11. Stop T-Pot: `CTRL-C` (it if was running in the foreground) and / or `docker compose down -v` to stop T-Pot entirely.

### 2.1 Required Ports üîå
Besides the ports generally needed by the OS, i.e. obtaining a DHCP lease, DNS, etc. T-Pot will require the following ports for incoming / outgoing connections. Review the [T-Pot Architecture](#technical-architecture) for a visual representation. Also some ports will show up as duplicates, which is fine since used in different editions.
