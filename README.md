## 2 MacOS Installation üçè
As Docker Desktop is rather limited not all honeypot types or T-Pot features are supported. Also remember, by default the macOS are blocking access from remote, so testing is limited to the host.

**System Requirements:**
The T-Pot installation needs at least 8-16 GB RAM, 128 GB free disk space as well as a working (outgoing non-filtered) internet connection.

To get things up and running just follow these steps:
1. Install Docker Desktop for [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
2. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/domedg/tpotce_MacOS/
   ```
3. Go to repo folder:
   ```sh
   cd tpotce_MacOS/
   ```
4. Copy the docker configuration file
   ```sh
   cp compose/mac_win.yml ./docker-compose.yml
   ```
5. Check if the script `genuser.sh` is executable, if is not run:
   ```sh
   chmod 777 genuser.sh
   ```
6. Create a `WEB_USER` by running `./genuser.sh` <br>
   If the `WEB_USER` is not properly set, check [Issue 5: WEB_USER Not Loaded](#issue-5-web_user-not-loaded).
    
7. Adjust the `.env` file by changing `TPOT_OSTYPE=linux` to `mac` or directly run:
    ```sh
    sed -i '' 's/^TPOT_OSTYPE=linux$/TPOT_OSTYPE=mac/' .env
    ```

8. You have to ensure on your own there are no port conflicts keeping T-Pot from starting up. Check the [list of required ports](#required-ports).
9. To start T-Pot run:
    ```
    docker compose up
    ```
    or  if you want T-Pot to run in the background:
    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    Before starting T-Pot, make sure Docker is running on your system.
10. During the first time running `docker-compose up`, you may encounter some issues. Check the [Installation Issues](#installation-issues) section to solve them. 
11. To Stop T-Pot press: `CTRL-C` (it if was running in the foreground) and / or `docker compose down -v` to stop T-Pot entirely.

### 2.1 Installation Issues ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In this section, you will find a guide to resolve the installation issues I encountered. Each issue is followed by its respective solution.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 1: Undefined Network in Docker Compose
**Issue:** When running `docker compose up`, you receive the error:
```diff
- service "citrixhoneypot" refers to undefined network citrixhoneypot_local: invalid compose project
```
**Solution:** Add the `citrixhoneypot_local` network to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
networks:
    citrixhoneypot_local:
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 2: Port Already in Use for Citrixhoneypot
**Issue:** When running `docker compose up`:
```diff
- Citrixhoneypot reports that port 443 is already in use.
```
**Solution:** Change the port from 443 to another free (8445 in this example) in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
# CitrixHoneypot service
  citrixhoneypot:
    container_name: citrixhoneypot
    restart: always
    depends_on:   
      tpotinit:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
     - citrixhoneypot_local
    ports:
     - "443:8445"
    image: ${TPOT_REPO}/citrixhoneypot:${TPOT_VERSION}
    pull_policy: ${TPOT_PULL_POLICY}  
    read_only: true
    volumes:
     - ${TPOT_DATA_PATH}/citrixhoneypot/log:/opt/citrixhoneypot/logs
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 3: Kibana not working
**Issue:** Kibana service not working
**Solution:** Inside the Kibana container, you need to set the `server.rewriteBasePath=true` variable.

Access the container using the `docker exec` command with the `-u root` option:
```sh
docker exec -u root -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```
To retrieve the container ID, run the following command:
```sh
docker ps -a
```
Edit the `/usr/share/kibana/config/kibana.yml` file by changing this variable from false to true:
```yaml
server.rewriteBasePath: true
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 4: Port Already Mapped for Snare
**Issue:** When running `docker compose up`:Snare reports that port 80 is already mapped.
```diff
- Snare reports that port 80 is already in use.
```
**Solution:** Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file by changing the port mapping from 80 to another available port (5695 for example):
```yaml
## Snare Service   
  snare:
    container_name: snare
    restart: always
    depends_on:
     - tanner  
    tty: true  
    networks:
     - tanner_local
    ports:   
     - "80:5695"
    image: ${TPOT_REPO}/snare:${TPOT_VERSION}
    pull_policy: ${TPOT_PULL_POLICY}
```
<a name="issue-5-web_user-not-loaded"></a>  
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 5: WEB_USER Not Loaded
**Issue:** Sometimes, running the `genuser.sh` script may not properly load the `WEB_USER` entry in the `.env` file.
**Solution:**
To check, open the `.env` file and verify if the `WEB_USER` variable is empty.  

If it is empty, generate a new value using the following command:  
```sh
htpasswd -n -b "username" "password" | base64 -w0
```
For example, running:
```sh
htpasswd -n -b "tsec" "tsec" | base64 -w0
```
Copy the generated string and manually replace the WEB_USER value in the .env file.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 5: Missing Directories in T-Pot Initialization
**Issue:** When running `docker compose up`, you may see the following lines in the T-Pot init logs:
```
tpotinit        | # Updating permissions ...
tpotinit        | 
tpotinit        | chmod: /data/nginx/conf: Permission denied
tpotinit        | chmod: /data/nginx/cert: Permission denied
...
```
**Solution:** To correct this and other issues of the same type, run:
```sh
chmod -R 770 data
```
**Note:** You may also encounter the following errors during T-Pot initialization:
```
tpotinit        | chmod: /data/adbhoney/downloads.tgz: No such file or directory
tpotinit        | chmod: /data/cowrie/log/ttylogs.tgz: No such file or directory
tpotinit        | chmod: /data/cowrie/downloads.tgz: No such file or directory
```
These errors are not critical and T-Pot should still function correctly.

### 2.2 Management Tips üõü

1. **Kibana**: Kibana does not start immediately as it needs to establish a connection with Elasticsearch. Generally, the containers that take the longest to start are Kibana, Dionaea and Conpot. To monitor the status of the containers, you can run:
    ```sh
    docker ps -a 
    ```
    If you want to see containers that have yet to start, you can run:
    ```sh
    docker ps -a | grep starting
    ```

3. **Get Service Ports**: You can get the exposed ports of a container with the following command:
    ```sh
    docker inspect <container_id> | grep "HostPort"
    ```

4. **Get Container ID**: To get the ID of a running container, use:
    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```
    This command lists all currently running containers, showing information such as the container ID, image, command, start time, status, and names.

5. **Get Service Address**: To get the IP address of a container, use:
    ```sh
    docker inspect <container_id> | grep "IPAddress"
    ```

6. **Run a Container with Root Permissions**: To run a shell inside a container with root permissions, use:
    ```sh
    docker exec -it --user root <container_id> /bin/sh
    ```
7. **Prune Unused Networks**: If you encounter network issues, you can remove all unused networks with the following command:
    ```sh
    docker network prune
    ```
    This command will prompt for confirmation before deleting all unused networks.
8. **Restart Containers**: Sometimes, simply restarting the containers can resolve issues. You can do this by bringing the containers down and then up again:
    ```sh
    docker-compose down && docker-compose up
    ```
    This command stops and removes the containers, then recreates and starts them.

### 2.4 Required Ports üîå
Besides the ports generally needed by the OS, i.e. obtaining a DHCP lease, DNS, etc. T-Pot will require the following ports for incoming / outgoing connections. Review the [T-Pot Architecture](#technical-architecture) for a visual representation. Also some ports will show up as duplicates, which is fine since used in different editions.
